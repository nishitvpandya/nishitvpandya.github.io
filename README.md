# Nishit Vinay Pandya

I am looking for a PhD position in the area of Computer Security and Privacy. I am particularly interested in the security of modern distributed, cloud based systems and applying novel cryptographic methods to minimise exposure of data and generate trust in third party systems.

I can be reached at [nishitvpandya@proton.me].
