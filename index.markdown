I am a second year PhD student in [Computer Science and Engineering at UC San Diego](https://cse.ucsd.edu), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Earlence Fernandes](https://www.earlence.com).<br> I work in AI security. Specifically, I am interested in approaches to create efficient attacks on LLMs and building principled defences for LLM-integrated systems.<br>

I got my first experience doing security research working with [Prof. Vinod Ganapathy](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~vg/).

I got my  BS and MS in mathematics from the [Indian Institute of Science](https://www.iisc.ac.in) in Bangalore - working mostly on topology and geometry.<br> I also had a brief stint in industry at [Datapoem](https://www.datapoem.com/) building AI to address the pain points of the marketing industry.
