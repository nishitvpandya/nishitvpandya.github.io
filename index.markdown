I am a first year PhD student in [Computer Science and Engineering at UC San Diego](https://cse.ucsd.edu), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Earlence Fernandes](https://www.earlence.com).<br> I am interested in the broad area of security.
Specifically, my interests include security of Machine Learning systems and applications of cryptography.<br>

I got my  BS (Research) and MS from the [Indian Institute of Science](https://www.iisc.ac.in) majoring in mathematics, where I worked on topology and geometry.<br> I also had a brief stint in industry at [Datapoem](https://www.datapoem.com/) building AI to address the pain points of the marketing industry.
