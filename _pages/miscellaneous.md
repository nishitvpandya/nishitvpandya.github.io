### *Quizzing*

Back in the day, I used to be an avid "quizzer" (in the Indian sense of the word). I also made several quizzes over the decade or so that I was active. Here are some of my favourites from the ones I "made" (at least to the extent that one can "make" existing knowledge into a well-phrased, workoutable, insightful question).

P.S. Look out for the Cryptic Crossword style questions at the end.
