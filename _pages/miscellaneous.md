### *Quizzing*

Back in the day, I used to be an avid "quizzer" (in the Indian sense of the word). I also made several quizzes over the decade or so that I was active. Here are some of my favourites from the ones I "made" (at least to the extent that one can "make" existing knowledge into a well-phrased, workoutable, insightful question).

P.S. Look out for the Cryptic Crossword style questions at the end.

### *Poetry*

I am a big proponent of the [Ramdas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ylg2Rtg3cgw) [Athawale](https://youtu.be/Pd_kTUNPxZc) [School](https://youtu.be/0ICD27qXkuI) [of](https://youtu.be/gW9tuyz_X0s?t=23) [Poetry](https://youtu.be/gRV8hLIfIi0). Inspired by these, here are a few poems I wrote -

<summary> Happy Birthday 1 </summary>
Happy Birthday ****** Singh.  
Tum Khushi se Karo dance and sing.  
Is birthday tum ko mile apni Pasand Ka Sara bling  
As a search engine, Google is better than bing.  

Tumhara DOTA2 me bana rahe forever low ping  
Aur good wishes se bajta rahe phone tring-tring.  
Happy birthday ****** Singh!

Today is birthday of ***** Chaudhary  
Hum Bhagwan se prarthana karte Hain ki uski jaldi lag jaaye Zindagi ki lottery  

We are fortunate ki hum Hain a part of his coterie  
Hamari yu hi bane camaraderie  
Happy Birthday *****Â Chaudhary

Aise hi bane raho ten on ten
