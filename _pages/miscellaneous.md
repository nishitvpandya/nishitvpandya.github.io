### *Quizzing*

Back in the day, I used to be an avid "quizzer" (in the Indian sense of the word). I also made several quizzes over the decade or so that I was active. Here are some of my favourites from the ones I "made" (at least to the extent that one can "make" existing knowledge into a well-phrased, workoutable, insightful question).

P.S. Look out for the Cryptic Crossword style questions at the end.

### *Poetry*

I am a big proponent of the [Ramdas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ylg2Rtg3cgw) [Athawale](https://youtu.be/Pd_kTUNPxZc) [School](https://youtu.be/0ICD27qXkuI) [of](https://youtu.be/gW9tuyz_X0s?t=23) [Poetry](https://youtu.be/gRV8hLIfIi0). As a homage to these, here are a few poems I wrote -

<summary> Happy Birthday 1 </summary>
<i>
Happy Birthday ****** Singh.  <br>
Tum Khushi se Karo dance and sing.  <br>
Is birthday tum ko mile apni Pasand Ka Sara bling  <br>
Tumhara DOTA2 me bana rahe forever low ping  <br>
Aur good wishes se bajta rahe phone tring-tring. <br> 
Happy birthday ****** Singh!  <br>

<details>
<summary> Happy Birthday 2 </summary>
<i>
Today is birthday of ***** Chaudhary  <br>
Hum Bhagwan se prarthana karte Hain ki uski jaldi lag jaaye Zindagi ki lottery  <br>
We are fortunate ki hum Hain a part of his coterie  <br>
Hamari yu hi bane camaraderie  <br>
Happy Birthday ***** Chaudhary  <br>

<summary> Happy Birthday 3 </summary>
<i>
Happy Birthday ***** Behen.  <br>
Tum Zindagi me acche acche kapde banao aur lo pehen  <br>
Aise hi bane raho ten on ten  <br>
Happy birthday ***** Behen.  <br>

### *Links* (to articles, essays, blogs etc. - mostly for my own reference)

1. [Paddy's Gita](https://web.iucaa.in/~paddy/answer/gita.pdf) - A very nice essay by the late T. Padmanabhan on the Bhagavad Gita. Written very much for someone with "modern sensibilities". Is also nicely formatted in LaTeX. :) :)  

2. [As We May Think](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/) - IMO, going from computers as "calculating machines" to computers as "knowledge organization machines" is the really visionary jump made by this essay. A true memex however still seems to be elusive.

3. Almost everything by [Martin Gardner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Gardner_bibliography)
